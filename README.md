### Specifications
1) When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
2) As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
3) Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
4) Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
5) Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
